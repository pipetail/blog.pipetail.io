      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had the chance to see quite a bit of clusters in our years of experience with kubernetes (both managed and unmanaged - on GCP, AWS and Azure), and we see some mistakes being repeated. No shame in that, we’ve done most of these too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll try to show the ones we see very often and talk a bit about how to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GitLab-CI/CD is a great and powerful product for CI/CD pipelines. Hosted gitlab.com solution offers shared runners and some usage minutes based on your paid plan (even if the free tier). Though you might want to run your own runner in your private or public cloud. I will show how to run GitLab runner on AWS using terraform, Elastic Kubernetes Service and GitLab kubernetes integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
