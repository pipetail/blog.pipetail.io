      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Marek, I&amp;rsquo;m a NoOps/NoCode enthusiast. Started as a C++ programmer while doing masters in Computer Systems and Networks.
Growing up in the SysAdmin era, I quickly realized communication and collaboration is the key.
Nowadays I focus on Cloud Architecting, microservices and Continuous Everything to solve business problems, not technical ones.
I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about traveling, minimalist, DevOps and Cloud Native.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Stepan, I started with automation back in 2010 as a technician in servers factory. Then, I moved to the consulting role in Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I spent in that factory for almost 7 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned there how to automate almost every deployment at any scale. Also, I got in touch with the platforms there. In 2018 it was about the time to move on and explore the real purpose of stuff I was implementing there.</description>
